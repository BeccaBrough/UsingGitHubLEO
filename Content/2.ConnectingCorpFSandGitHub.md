## Connecting CorpFS and GitHub

### Step 1. Set up Project Reposity in GitHub
- Create a repo from GitHub's website interface; click the plus button in the upper right corner of the GitHub homepage and click "New Repository"
- Select features for this reposity 
  - You'll likely want to select "Private"
  - Select initalize with README; README files should tell the user key information about the files uploaded in that repo.

### Option 1. Connect Existing GitHub respository to local computer
- This option makes sense for new projects and new project folders. If you would like to migrate existing code to GitHub, then please read the instructions for Option 2. 

  #### 1.1. Clone Online Repository to Local Computer 
  - Open the git bash you installed; 
  - Use the following code to clone your respository in a LEO folder. 
  - Find the correct url-to-repo by clicking the "Clone or Download" button on the homepage of your repository
  ```
  cd /path/to/leo/folder/you/want/connected/to/github/
  git clone url-to-repo (e.g. https://github.com/BeccaBrough/UsingGitHubLEO.git)
  ```
### Option 2:  Connect Existing Folder in CorpFS to Repos in GitHub

- This option is best for existing projects that already have files stored in CorpFS 

  #### 2.1 Initiate this existing folder as a GitHub folder 
  - You can tell Git that you want this folder to be synced to GitHub with the following code 
  ```
  cd /path/to/leo/folder/you/want/connected/to/github/
  git init
  ```

  #### 2.2 Choose files from newly initiated folder you would like synced with GitHub
  - Use the following code to upload existing files to 
  ```
  git add . (or git add "FILENAME" to only add specific files)
  ```
    #### Troubleshooting
    When I first did this, I received the following error 
    *"Fatal: cannot use .git/info/exclude as an exclude file"* 
    If you receive this error, the following steps resolve this 
    ##### 1. Delete These exclude files 
    Navigate to .git/info/ and delete the "exclude" file 
    ##### 2. Change your configuration to ignore exclude files 
    Run the following in the command prompt: 
    ```
    git config --global core.fsache false 
    ```
  ### 2.3 Add these selected files to online GitHub repo
  ```
  git commit -m "Adding Existing Folder to GitHub"
  git remote add origin url-to-repo
  git push -f origin master 
  ```

  ### 2.4 More Resources 
  If you are connecting an code folder to GitHub for the first time and would like to know how to convert your files named "code_v1" "code_v2", etc. into a single file while preserving all these variatons, read this guide.
