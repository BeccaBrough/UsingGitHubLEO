# Convert Existing Version Controls to GitHub 
First, you will need to have initiated this folder as a GitHub folder. For more information on this, read this page and follow the steps outlined in Option 2. 

## Consolidate files to a single master file
Let's assume your existing folder has 3 versions of code. code_v1; code_v2; code_v3. We are going to create one file called "code" while preserving the changes you made between versions 1-3. You will be able to see exactly what changes were made by reviewing the "history" of your code in GitHub. 

## Step 1
- Open code_v1 and rename file "code" 
- Add the date you last worked on this code to the top of the file (this is important, becuase when you are adding these to Git, Git will think you are making these changes to the code now.)
- Save new file 

## Step 2
- Open Git Bash and commit this change
- Each time you commit something; you are telling Git to preserve the current version of the document 
```
cd "path/to/folder"
git add .
git commit -m "Version 1"
```
## Step 3 
- Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all subsequent files (rename code_v2 "code", add a date, save, and commit this change). If you can remember how V1 and V2 of files differ, add this in this message (eg. -m "V2 adds code to create enrollment over time graph")

## Step 4 
- Now that you have you a single file "code" with all previous versions preserved in the commit history, you are ready to upload this code to GitHub
- You can delete the files: code_v1 code_v2 code_v3
```
git commit -m "Deleted Other Versions"
git add .
git remote add origin url-to-repo (if you don't have this stored already)
git push orign master
```
