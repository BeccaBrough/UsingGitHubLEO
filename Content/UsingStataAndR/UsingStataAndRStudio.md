# Using Stata and R Studio Tutorial

**Summary:** This tutorial shows you how to use R Studio and Stata. R Studio is a nice interface that allows you to run R. Using R, you can create an RMarkdown file which allows you to run code in chuncks and describe what your doing in text. Something like this. This is a nice output, especially for sharing reports with partners.

Here, I run code:
```
code 
```

**Knit output:** You can output your RMarkdown file to 3 types of output documents: HTML, PDF, and Word. 
- **Word**: To use word, I have found it easiest to start with a simple word template as a reference document. You can modify the style of this document, and simply reference this when you "knit" your Rmarkdown file. More information on this [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html)  
- **HTML**: Pretty straightforward, knits to a HTML document that appears like a website when you open it. 
- **PDF**: Similar output to word, although I have not yet experimented with ways to change reference styles here.
